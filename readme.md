# Tiger Moth Aerobatic Smoke (MSFS)

This is a mod to [Ant's Tiger Moth for MSFS](https://www.antsairplanes.com/msfstigermoth.html) to add aerobatic smoke. It is based on (and should be used with) v1.4.1.

Coloured display smoke (red/white/blue) can be set using the following controls (choose whatever key/joystick combinations as appropriate):

Effect                                 | Control Name               | Suggested Binding
---------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------
Toggle White Smoke (MSFS 2020/2024)    | `Smoke Toggle`             | <kbd>i</kbd>
Toggle White Smoke  (MSFS 2020 only *) | `Toggle Windshield Deice`  | <kbd>i</kbd>
Toggle Blue Smoke                      | `Toggle Engine 1 Anti Ice` | <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd></kbd>
Toggle Red Smoke                       | `Toggle Plasma`            | <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd></kbd>
Toggle Smoke Intensity                 | `Toggle G Limiter`         | <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd></kbd>

(*) White smoke used to be controlled by `Toggle Windshield Deice`, but this didn't work in MSFS 2024 so has been changed to `Smoke Toggle`. For compatibility, `Toggle Windshield Deice` will continue to work in MSFS 2020 for the time being, but as of v1.1.0, this should be considered deprecated and may be removed in a future version. Please update your mappings to use `Smoke Toggle` instead.

The smoke has two intensity levels. The default is "more intense". It can be switched to "less intense" with the `Toggle G Limiter`
