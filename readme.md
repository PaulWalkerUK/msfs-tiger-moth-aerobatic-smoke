# CIX Tiger Moth Mod (MSFS)

This is a mod to Ant's Tiger Moth for MSFS to make some tweaks for CIX VFR Club.

Coloured display smoke (red/white/blue) can be set using the following controls (choose whatever key/joystick combinations as appropriate):

Effect             | Control Name             | Suggested binding
-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------
Toggle White Smoke | Toggle Windshield Deice  | i
Toggle Blue Smoke  | Toggle Engine 1 Anti Ice | Shift + i
Toggle Red Smoke   | Toggle Plasma            | Ctrl + i

There have also been some tweaks to performance so the plane more closely matches the performance of the Tiger Moth in FSX and XPlane.
